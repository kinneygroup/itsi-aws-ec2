### Services
The content pack includes the following services, each representing a critical component of EC2 performance monitoring:
- **AWS EC2 Instance Performance**: The primary service that aggregates CPU, disk, and network performance data to provide a holistic view of instance health.
- **AWS EC2 CPU Performance**: Monitors CPU utilization and credit usage, crucial for processing capabilities and burstable performance instances.
- **AWS EC2 Disk Performance**: Tracks disk I/O and throughput, essential for storage subsystem performance.
- **AWS EC2 Network Performance**: Ensures adequate network bandwidth and connectivity for the instance.

### KPIs
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) included in the content pack are designed to provide actionable insights into the performance of EC2 instances:
- **CPU Utilization**: Measures the percentage of compute units in use, indicating the processing load on the instance.
- **Disk I/O Operations**: Counts the read and write operations, reflecting the instance's ability to handle storage operations.
- **Network Throughput**: Monitors inbound and outbound network traffic, assessing the instance's data transfer capabilities.

### Relationships
The content pack defines dependencies between services to reflect the interconnected nature of EC2 instance performance metrics. For example, the overall AWS EC2 Instance Performance is dependent on the CPU, Disk, and Network Performance services.
